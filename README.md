# avl

**avl** (or AVL), standing for both **a**rray **v**ariant **l**anguage and **a**d**v**ent **l**anguage, is a tacit array language designed with solving [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges in mind. It has two main principles in mind - to be concise, and to have structures from conventional languages that makes it easier to get into. It has elements of imperative languages as its structures in the overall program, and combines these together via tacit chaining.

It is inspired by array languages like APL, J, and K, and its tacit structure is inspired by Jelly. The idea to use conventional structures in combination with something that can be very golfy is inspired by Vyxal. However, avl is not made to be a golfing language - it values conciseness, but still readability.
